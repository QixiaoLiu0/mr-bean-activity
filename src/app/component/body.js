        <h2>The Character</h2>
        <p>
          Mr. Bean is a global comedic icon. He lives alone in his flat in
          Highbury, North London, and is almost always seen in his trademark
          tweed jacket and thin red tie. He rarely speaks, and when he does, it
          is usually only a few mumbled words in a low-pitched voice.

          <li>

        <h2>Global Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          Despite only 15 original live-action episodes being made, the
          character's reliance on physical comedy (slapstick) rather than
          dialogue allowed it to be sold to 245 territories worldwide, making
          Mr. Bean one of the most recognized faces on the planet.
